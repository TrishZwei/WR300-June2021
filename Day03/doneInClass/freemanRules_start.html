        <h1>Morgan <b>Freeman</b></h1>
        <p class="summary">Class act. With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. He's now one of Hollywood's most respected stars.</p>

          <p><b> I now issue a new commandment:</b> Thou shalt do the dance. Boxing is about respect. Getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the Discovery Channel from time to time. But I guess you can't now, being dead and all. It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world. Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd. Multiply your anger by about a hundred, Kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. </p>

          <p><b>Cities fall but they are rebuilt.</b> Heroes die but they are remembered. The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks.

Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means. The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.
