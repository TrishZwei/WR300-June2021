			  <p>Stolen almost lock stock and barrel from CSS Tricks' pen.  Played around with the points, added new ones, etc. Found this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0iOzwXr5K4) that uses a chrome extension. That extension didn't work for me, but I used firefox for shape editing in the inspector as soon as I found out there was a thing for it. Firefox is seriously impressing me as of late when it comes to CSS tools. Shape outside is pretty dang cool.</p>

		    <h1>About <br>Van Gogh</h1>
		    <p>Vincent van Gogh, one of the most well-known post-impressionist artists, for whom color was the chief symbol of expression, was born in Groot-Zundert, Holland on March 30, 1853.</p>
		    <p>In a decade, Vincent Willem van Gogh created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic,impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at thirty-seven came after years of depression and poverty.</p>
